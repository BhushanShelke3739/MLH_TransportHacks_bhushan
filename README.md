# MLH_TransportHacks_bhushan
Bus ETA and Best Bus Checker - This is my submission for the MLH TransportHacks hackathon!
## Inspiration
I missed lot's of buses during my college, maybe this could be a solution
## What it does
There are predefined routes, speeds. The user can anywhere be in between the start and end and he/she  can enter their location using the dropdown to find the time remaining for the bus to come.
Also, there is a option for observing traffic info. which needs some work to be done on it.
## How I built it
I did it individually with some help on the internet, thought about the challenges faced by me as well as many of my friends and took one problem on which I have worked!
## Challenges I ran into
ETA is a field which also gets affected by external factors such as traffic, weather, accidents and not only speed and distance. This was a major challenge! Also this could be solved by installing some sort of tracking unit on the bus.
## Accomplishments that I'mproud of
I did something and got something which I wanted! This is my first hackathon and I am proud that I was able to code a problem to get some solution!
## What Ilearned
Python, Streamlit, Public transportation issues.
## What's next for Bus ETA and Best Bus checker
This is just a basic application, It can be upscaled by adding more routes, stops, users and tweaking the ETA calculation methods!
